      <h1>My Favourite Meal: MATOKE WITH BEEF STEW RECIPE</h1>
    </header>

      <h2>About the food:</h2>
      <p>
        Also called matooke, matoke is the name given to plantains, a type of
        green banana, in certain areas of eastern African, specifically Uganda.
        Matoke are a staple crop, as well as a staple food, in eastern Africa.
        The term also refers to a dish made from these plantains. In fact, the
        stew-like dish is a national dish of Uganda.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the fruit itself is the same yellowish color as a banana, the
        plantain's peel may be green or even black. Unlike bananas, plantains
        should be cooked before they are eaten. In Africa, the fruit is often
        steamed in its own leaves and may also be included in a variety of
        dishes, much like potatoes in European and American countries. Plantains
        can be found in the produce section of grocery stores in many countries.

      <h3>Steps or methods to prepare:</h3>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          Peel and cut the matoke into 1.5 – 2 inch pieces. Put them in water
          till you are ready to use them so that they don’t become discolored.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add onions, and
          cook until soft, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant—a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the beef and add the paprika, curry powder, bouillon powder,
          salt, and pepper. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook for 10 minutes,
          stirring halfway between.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the matoke, diced tomatoes, and stock (or water), stir, cover, and
          leave to simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or till the matoke becomes
          tender.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the coriander and serve.</li>
      </ol>

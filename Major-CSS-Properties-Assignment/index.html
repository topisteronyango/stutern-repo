        <h3>Name: Topister Onyango</h3>
            <p><b>My love for technology made me find interest a career in technology </b>because it's an opportunity
                to combine my analytical skills with my innovative and creative abilities. As a <i>Software engineer,
            </i> I believe that technology represents unlimited possibilities, especially in the video game 
        industry. I find working in technology to be a rewarding career that allows me to learn new skills 
        every day and use them to create unique games that transport users to distant worlds. Ultimately, 
        I plan to become a senior game developer, and this position can help me develop the skills for that 
        position.</p>

        <p>I've been interested in <b>game creation</b> since I was a kid, but I really 
            discovered my passion for it when I took part in a game development boot camp last summer. After 
            learning key skills in <i>video game development,</i> we participated in a hackerthon competition. 
            Seeing how every piece of coding works together to create an interactive 
            game was an exciting experience, and I plan to bring my skills to help Genuflect Games create that 
            experience for their users."</p>

        <h3><i>Importance of css</i></h3>
        <p>CSS is important because it controls all design-related aspects of your website. 
            <b>Typography, colours, page layouts and any other visual aspects of your website</b> are all controlled by CSS.</p>
